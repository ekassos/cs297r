## Tier 3: Studying a pre-existing system, implementing a modification and evaluating its impact with a user study

### [üìù Final implementation report](https://github.com/ekassos/cs297r/blob/main/Towards%20an%20Improved%20Shortcuts%20App%20through%20Siri%20Shortcuts.pdf)

**Abstract:** The Shortcuts app is an application distributed by Apple across its platforms and enables users to extend the functionality of their devices with personalized shortcuts. User evaluation showed that the current version of the application lacked adequate tools to discover actions, the building blocks of shortcuts, and debug user-created shortcuts. This project introduces extra functionality to aid in action discovery and shortcut troubleshooting, built on top of the Shortcuts app through Siri shortcuts. A user study empirically verified that the proposed interventions enhanced the Shortcuts experience for both novice and advanced users. What remains to be seen is the impact on the user experience after the interventions' integration in the Shortcuts application.
